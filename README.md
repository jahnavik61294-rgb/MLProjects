# Loan Default Prediction Project

Project Overview

This project predicts the probability of loan default using historical loan and client data. The solution implements an end-to-end ML workflow, including:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Model development and evaluation

Experiment tracking and CI/CD pipelines

Containerized deployment with monitoring and alerting

The goal is to provide a robust, production-ready machine learning solution following best practices.
